Set of programs to read the data from the alibava setup used in the EPIc test beam.
Current problems:
- check of the info needed from the config file
- run number finding algorithm to be improved
- in the calibration the measureed PH is not 0 for 0 charge injection

Note on the Makefile:
The Makefile will produce an object (.o) in obj for each .cc and .cpp file in src.
For each .cpp file in src an ececutable will be created in executables.
The include/clusterDef.h file is used with include/LinkDef.h to create a root dictionary
for the struct cluster, the dictionary is compiled and linked with the rest of the project.
