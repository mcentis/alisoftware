Set of programs to read the data from the alibava setup used in the EPIc test beam.
Current problems:
- check clustering algorithm to exlude used strips
- check clustering algorithm to add neighbouring seeds to the clusers
- check that the selection of the polarity of the pulse for the seeds works
- check of the info needed from the config file
- run number finding algorithm to be improved
- calibration runs to be done

Note on the Makefile:
The Makefile will produce an object (.o) in obj for each .cc and .cpp file in src.
For each .cpp file in src an ececutable will be created in executables.
The include/clusterDef.h file is used with include/LinkDef.h to create a root dictionary
for the struct cluster, the dictionary is compiled and linked with the rest of the project.
