Current problems:
- check clustering algorithm to exlude used strips
- check clustering algorithm to add neighbouring seeds to the clusers
- check that the selection of the polarity of the pulse for the seeds works
- check of the info needed from the config file
- run number finding algorithm to be improved
- calibration runs to be done
